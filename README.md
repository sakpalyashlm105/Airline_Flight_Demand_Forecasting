# Airline_Flight_Demand_Forecasting

This project performs time series analysis and forecasting on monthly air passenger traffic data to predict future air ticket demand.

### 1. Data
The dataset contains 144 observations of monthly total airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. It can be found in the AirPassengers.csv file.

### 2. Methods
The following analyses and models are implemented:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Time series decomposition
* Making the time series stationary through transformations
* Auto Regressive (AR) model
* Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model
